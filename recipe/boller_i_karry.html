                <li>2.5 dl milk (preferably whole milk)</li>
                <li>>3 tablespoons flour</li>

        <h2>Directions</h2>
            <h3>Meatballs</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Arrow and chop onion finely. Mix pork, chopped onion, flour and eggs and stir it into a chewy stuffing. Add a little salt and pepper too.
                    </li>
                    <li>your meatloaf into meatballs - use a tablespoon to help you. Heat some water or chicken stock up to boiling point and pour in your meatballs. They should cook for approx. 8 minutes. Set aside to peel in the curry sauce.
                    </li>
                </ol>        
            <h3>Buns in curry - The classic version</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt butter in a pan or saucepan and add curry and turmeric - let it cook for half a minute. Flour is added and it is whipped together. Add chicken stock little by little while continuing to whip - the consistency should be a little too thick for you to eat it.
                    </li>
                    <li>Stir the curry sauce with a little milk and season with salt and. Possibly. a little piment d’espelette or cayenne pepper.
                    </li>
                    <li>Pour your meatballs into the sauce and let them stand for a few minutes over medium heat until they are thoroughly heated and ready to eat. Serve with rice or bulgur. For this version, I prefer rice
                    </li>      
                </ol>
